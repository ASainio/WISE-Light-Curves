| theta_pm       | float64  | deg    | Weighted proper motion angular difference. This accounts for both the direction and magnitude of the motion vectors, reducing the influence of small proper motions with high uncertainty. The weighting is based on the ratio of the Gaia proper motion magnitude to the combined proper motion error, using a smooth scaling function. The weighted angle is computed as:  
  \[
  \theta_{\text{pm, weighted}} = \theta \times \tanh\left(\frac{|\vec{PM}_{\text{GAIA}}|}{\sigma_{\text{PM}} + 10^{-5}}\right)
  \]

  where \( \theta \) is the raw angular difference in degrees, \( |\vec{PM}_{\text{GAIA}}| \) is the Gaia proper motion magnitude, and \( \sigma_{\text{PM}} \) is the combined proper motion uncertainty from Gaia and WISE.
