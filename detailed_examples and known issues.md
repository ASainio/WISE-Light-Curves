Known issues:
- Colormap contains only 20 colors and currently there are 23 epochs. Therefor some epochs use same color.
Epoch colors are added to visualize data scattering when plotting off-set and folded light curves.
This should visualize better positional outliers from epoch clustering and in folded lightcurves it should reveal that epochs are not clustered.

- Baseline is a guess based on where 65-values have most datapoints to cover. In symmetric attached eclipsing binary system it is possible that amount of datapoints on each magnitude is about the same and therefor faintest end could be guessed.

Example of Baseline guess on multiple sources:
