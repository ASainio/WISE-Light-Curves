| in65 | float64  | number    | ![Alt text](https://github.com/ASainio/WISE-Light-Curves/blob/main/null-hyph.png) 0-hypothesis values are first counted from mean magnitude of filtered data. Then Baseline is estimated by finding the magnitude where 65 range cover most of datapoints. Datapoints in, below and over are counted and expressed as %. These values can be used to compare variability and it might indicate type of variability (dimming or brightening compared to baseline). |
